The printer also has the ability to print in nylon (\nreference\n).\n\n\nFibers\n\n\nThe Markforged can also embed continuous fiber strands within the layers of a print. This greatly improves various properties of the part but also greatly increases print times. Information on the properties of these fibers can be found by clicking on the following links:\n\n\n\n\nFiberglass\n - Strong\n\n\nHSHT Fiberglass\n - Strong and high temperature\n\n\nCarbon Fiber\n - Strong and stiff\n\n\nKevlar\n - Abrasion resistant and flexible\n\n\n\n\nPrinting\n\n\nTo use the printer, you need to be trained by a MarkForged Ninja. If you have a part to be printed and are not trained, ask a ninja to add it to the queue, and they will notify you upon completion.\n\n\nFill out \nthis form\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\nThe Markforged printer used by the Olin Robotics Lab is set up to interface with \nEiger\n, an online web interface that handles part slicing and orientation as well as the print queue for the printer. Talk to the Markforged Ninjas about getting access to Eiger.\n\n\nCleaning \n Maintenance\n\n\n\n\nPurging\n: If the MarkForged hasn't printed in a few hours, it will print a thick strand of material on the far back edge upon startup to purge the extruder. If the printer is already warmed up, the test line will be much less substantial.\n\n\nRemoving Parts\n: The build plate of the Markforged printer can be damaged during part removal. When removing parts, only use the yellow-handled scraper (due to the thickness of the blade), place the build plate on it's end on a table, and scrape directly down the plate.\n\n\nGeneral Cleaning\n: Every few prints, the build plate needs to be wiped clean of glue residue. Take the build plate to a sink, wet a paper towel, and rub until the glue softens, then wipe off with a dry paper towel. Repeat until the build surface is no longer sticky. If strands of filament or dust build up inside the Markforged case, remove them and throw away.",
