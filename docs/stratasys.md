# Stratasys
## Overview
The Stratasys 3D printers are used extensively by the robolab as the go-to printers.

## Information
- **Ninjas**: Carl Moser, Christina Segar
- **Names**: Andrew, Barry
- **Location**: AC226
- **Materials**: ABS and Soluble Support

## Materials
Stratasys prints are made of ABS, a strong and tough thermoplasic that is resistant to impacts. It is less brittle and more heat resistant than PLA. The Stratasys machines also use a soluble support matterial to help with overhangs and bridging.

## Build Volume
The build volume of the Stratasys is 9.5" x 9.5" x 11.75" (241.3 mm x 241.3 mm x 298.4 mm)

## Printing
If you have a part to be printed, fill out the following form, and the RP Ninjas will notify you upon completion. If you have a part to be printed and it is not SCOPE/class/research related, talk to Prof. David Barrett first.

If you have multiple parts to print, please submit them as a single STL.

- [Single STL Onshape]()


Fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsqf-wnN6Tf1JjVtq8iTumT-SjDHye2qAZa94RPw8yIjEISA/viewform) to submit prints

## Lead Times
Unlike most of the other 3D printers on campus, the Stratasys use a soluble support material. Depending on the geometry of the part, there may be support material that cannot be broken off and will need to be dissolved. This process involves roughly 6-12 hours in the lye bath, 24 hours in the grey water tank, and 6-12 hours drying. If you absolutely need a part sooner, email the RP Ninjas and we will do what we can to expedite this process.
