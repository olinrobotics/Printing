# Markforged
## Overview
The Mark Two Markforged printer is used extensively by the robolab when a part is mission-critical and needs to be as strong as possible.

## Information
- **Ninjas**: Lauren Gulland, Carl Moser, Connor Novak, Isaac Vandor
- **Name**: Markey McMarkForged
- **Location**: AC226
- **Materials**: Onyx, Nylon (ninja use only)

## Materials
Markforged prints are almost exclusively done in onyx, a material made of nylon fused with chopped carbon fiber ([reference](https://markforged.com/blog/introducing-our-new-markforged-material-onyx/)). The printer also has the ability to print in nylon ([reference](https://markforged.com/materials/#nylon)).

## Fibers
The Markforged can also embed continuous fiber strands within the layers of a print. This greatly improves various properties of the part but also greatly increases print times. Information on the properties of these fibers can be found by clicking on the following links:


- [Fiberglass](https://markforged.com/materials/#fiberglass) - Strong
- [HSHT Fiberglass](https://markforged.com/materials/#hsht-fiberglass) - Strong and high temperature
- [Carbon Fiber](https://markforged.com/materials/#carbon-fiber) - Strong and stiff
- [Kevlar](https://markforged.com/materials/#kevlar) - Abrasion resistant and flexible

## Printing
To use the printer, you need to be trained by a MarkForged Ninja. If you have a part to be printed and are not trained, ask a ninja to add it to the queue, and they will notify you upon completion.

## Software
The Markforged printer used by the Olin Robotics Lab is set up to interface with [Eiger](eiger.io), an online web interface that handles part slicing and orientation as well as the print queue for the printer. Talk to the Markforged Ninjas about getting access to Eiger.

## Cleaning & Maintenance
- **Purging**: If the MarkForged hasn't printed in a few hours, it will print a thick strand of material on the far back edge upon startup to purge the extruder. If the printer is already warmed up, the test line will be much less substantial.
- **Removing Parts**: The build plate of the Markforged printer can be damaged during part removal. When removing parts, only use the yellow-handled scraper (due to the thickness of the blade), place the build plate on it's end on a table, and scrape directly down the plate.
- **General Cleaning**: Every few prints, the build plate needs to be wiped clean of glue residue. Take the build plate to a sink, wet a paper towel, and rub until the glue softens, then wipe off with a dry paper towel. Repeat until the build surface is no longer sticky. If strands of filament or dust build up inside the Markforged case, remove them and throw away.
